<p>I’ve gone to church all my life and “The Golden Rule” has been pound into my head since I was a toddler: “Do to others as you would have them do to you.” That’s Jesus talking in Matthew 7:12, by the way. Now, I’m not going to preach, so don’t navigate away too quickly… Well, I’m not going to preach about the Bible anyhow. I guess I am going to preach a little about how I think software developers should change their evil ways.</p></p>

                    <p> <p>Part of being a software craftsman is knowing how to recognize exceptions. Really, it takes time to build up enough experience seeing and fixing exceptions so that you can simply say, “I’ve seen this before. The problem is…” Along the way, when you find an exception that’s not very helpful in its message, get in the habit of looking at the inner exceptions until you reach the first exception. That will probably be the one that tells you what the real problem it is. Then remember the exception by its type or the error message so that you don’t have to google anything next time.</p></p>
